How to run the game

Write the next commands (for building and running the game for the first time) to the terminal when in src folder:
1. chmod +x hillclimb.sh
1. ./hillclimb.sh
Wait for a while when the game builds. When the build is ready the main menu screen will open automatically.
2. Enjoy the game!

After that you need to run the command: ./main to run the game again.
